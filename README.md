# Placement-Preparation
#The placement session for any company generally has 3 – 4 rounds. The first round is the written test, consisting of quantitative aptitude, reasoning (logical ability), English (verbal ability) and computer science subjects (C, C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, DBMS, OS, Networks, etc.).
For some companies, you might also have a coding round, which is sometimes taken as a separate round and sometimes is clubbed with the written test.
Further rounds are interview rounds, the first two usually being the technical round and successive rounds being the HR round.
For Placements Round 2 (Coding Test), you need to be familiar with competitive programming. You can practice competitive programming on practice.geeksforgeeks.org. You can also refer company specific coding questions and topic specific coding questions.
For Placements Round 3 (Interviews), we are planning to arrange for online mock interviews. But for the time, you can refer interview experiences on GeeksQuiz and interview experiences on GeeksforGeeks.
